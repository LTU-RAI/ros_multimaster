# Server
This is the server dictionary everything put here should deal with the data recieved and published.
The server should enable both off-loading data and transmitting data through the server. The data sent should be
synchronized in time and also check for lost packages.

Everything should be easily connected to an online interface where you can enable different programs on different machines.

Perhaps add functionality to use rosbag files for easy experimentation.

Dealing with different message types. Should have functionality to subscribe to any topic.
